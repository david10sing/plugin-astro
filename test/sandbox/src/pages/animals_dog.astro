    <h1>Dog</h1>
    <p>
      The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. The
      dog is derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. The dog
      was the first species to be domesticated, by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of
      agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic
      individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.
